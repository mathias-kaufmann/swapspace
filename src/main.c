/** Unix IPC sucks.
 *
 * It's all very powerful and flexible, but the primitives are too many and
 * vastly overweight.  One-size-fits-all can be very useful, but in the case of
 * signals it also causes a lot of problems.  We can be interrupted at any
 * moment, so we really can't assume anything about the current state of the
 * program--yet the compiler has to optimize with one hand tied behind its back
 * because it must respect sequence points no matter when the signal comes in.
 * Our programs could be running much faster than they are, if only the compiler
 * weren't obliged to assume that signal handlers may interact with the program
 * and keep even non-volatile variables synchronized for this purpose.
 *
 * This helped kill the Alpha architecture, by the way.  The Alpha AXP was a
 * beautiful, clean 64-bit RISC processor family designed by DEC (the Digital
 * Equipment Corporation, later acquired by Compaq, which in turn was later
 * acquired by HP) that was almost endian-neutral because it simply didn't have
 * single-byte or 16-bit memory accesses.  Everything went to and from memory in
 * larger chunks, so ECC checking could be moved off the motherboard and into
 * the processor itself; loops over text and such could be vectorized to read
 * and write entire 64-bit registers, i.e. 8 bytes at a time.  Both of these
 * ideas were expected to make a huge difference, since memory traffic is the
 * most stringent system performance bottleneck today.  But it didn't work out,
 * and the 8-bit and 16-bit load/store instructions were eventually added to the
 * architecture, increasing performance on the order of 20%.
 *
 * One reason for the change was that device drivers sometimes needed 8-bit or
 * 16-bit memory-mapped hardware accesses.  Windows NT introduced wrapper macros
 * for such accesses that enabled an MMU-based workaround on Alpha systems.  But
 * since these macros were no-ops on Intel x86-compatible processors, device
 * driver writers often failed to use them.  If Linux had hit the big time a bit
 * earlier, DEC
 *
 * The other reason why these instructions were added were signal handlers.  The
 * idea of vectorizing common loops was great; it was a precursor to today's
 * generation of vector instruction set extensions (first SPARC's VIS, later 
 * Intel's MMX and PowerPC's Altivec/VMX).  It got such great performance that
 * compiler engineers at Intel wouldn't stop programming until they could do the
 * same trick.  Alpha was so fast at the time that it outran the top-of-the-line
 * Pentium Pro on the still-popular SPECint92 benchmarks... even while emulating
 * the x86 version of the code!  Intel finally thought they nailed the problem,
 * until Motorola engineers discovered a bug in the generated code: a vital loop
 * was vectorized so it did multiple iterations at a time, but it no longer
 * looped.  The affected benchmark was giving the correct answers through sheer
 * coincidence.  It turned out this mistake had inflated their compound
 * performance rating for the entire SPECint suite by an embarassing 15%.
 *
 * Unfortunately, DEC's compiler engineers found that they could not use their
 * aggressive optimizations in real life.  The compiler never knows when a
 * signal is going to arrive, and yet it must synchronize the in-memory state of
 * most variables when it happens.  Which means practically all of the time!
 * This perhaps goes some way towards explaining that 20% performance benefit of
 * adding the extra load/store instructions: the optimizations that would have
 * made them unnecessary could be stunningly effective--but they could almost
 * never be used because they might break signal handling!
 *
 * Yet despite all the conservative compiler care in the world it remains
 * terribly hard and complex to avoid serious bugs in signal handlers: you may
 * be logging to an output sink that isn't quite ready for use yet, or has just
 * been closed, or was just doing something else.  You may want to change a
 * variable that the main process was changing at the same time.  It's got all
 * the problems of multithreading, but without the aid of synchronization
 * primitives (okay, so you get race conditions in place of deadlocks).
 *
 * Now that we're here, feel free to build your own lightweight mechanism on top
 * of this that does something actually useful!
 *
 * All we really want is to set a flag saying "an exit was requested."  We don't
 * even need to know when, how many times, or by whom.  A modern kernel would
 * provide a primitive for just that, and build signal functionality on top of
 * it--not to mention select() and poll() and such.
 *
 * Look at the Amiga OS for a shining example:
 *  - A "signal" is just a bit in the process descriptor that can be set
 *    atomically by another process, the process itself, or even an interrupt
 *    handler.  As with Unix select(), a process can atomically retrieve and
 *    clear any set of incoming signals, optionally sleeping first if nothing in
 *    the set has arrived yet.  Delivery is asynchronous.
 *  - All interrupt handling is done in the "bottom half;" signals are efficient
 *    enough to guarantee that the handler is woken up in time.  The decision to
 *    reschedule the signaled process is a simple matter of comparing the signal
 *    to a sleep mask.
 *  - Other forms of IPC build on top of the signal interface, using it to flag
 *    message arrival and such.  But many basic forms of event notification,
 *    such as a timer going off, or modification of a watched file, require only
 *    that simple single-bit signal.
 *  - Unix-style signal handlers can be registered as "exceptions."  These are
 *    all managed in terms of signal masks.  As it turned out this was not what
 *    anybody actually wanted; it was documented in the late 1980's but not
 *    properly implemented until 1992 because nobody ever tried to use it for
 *    anything anyway.  Or nobody apart from a Unix emulation library, perhaps.
 *    Everybody else just uses the single bit for communication and does the
 *    rest of the work in the event loop.
 *  - The graphical subsystem communicates with applications through these
 *    lightweight mechanisms, allowing a single process to provide effectively
 *    hard-realtime GUI responsiveness even while the application is busy.  You
 *    want to resize a window?  If the owner doesn't signal its willingness to
 *    repaint within 15 milliseconds, the system lets you know it's not going to
 *    happen.  You click a button while the application doesn't have time for
 *    you?  Either it's set up to send a signal, which will happen on cue, or it
 *    will "feel dead" from the start and it won't suddenly wake up and "become
 *    clicked" later.  You select a different radio button or move the mouse
 *    into a sensitive region?  The application isn't even woken up unless it
 *    registered an interest.  It's all stunningly efficient.
 *
 *  Instead, we need the system to schedule and/or interrupt our process, mask
 *  the signal and jump through hoops to deal with various types of other
 *  signals that may come in before we're finished handling this one, interrupt
 *  any system call that we may be in (which must of course be able to deal with
 *  this correctly), save execution context on the stack, invoke our handler
 *  function (making the signal number available to us just in case we're
 *  interested, which we're not), note completion of the handler, check for and
 *  deal with any other incoming signals, unmask our signal and restore normal
 *  running state, and return our process to where it was when it all happened. 
 *  The program pays the cost of expecting that any system call may return
 *  unexpectedly with an error code of "oops, a signal arrived."
 *
 *  And all this just so we can write one lousy Boolean to memory.  One single
 *  stinking bit.
